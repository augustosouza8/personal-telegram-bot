Message Handler Module (Updated for Conversation Summarization)

This module processes incoming messages:
    1. Preprocesses the user's message.
    2. Checks for media requests and sends an email alert if needed.
    3. Updates the conversation summary using the summarizer module.
    4. Constructs a prompt that includes the current conversation summary and the new user message.
    5. Calls the LLM integration module to generate a response.
    6. Updates the conversation summary with the bot's response.
    7. Returns the generated response.
